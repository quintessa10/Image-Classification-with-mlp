# Image-Classification-with-morden-MLP(multi-layer perceptron)

MLPs are used for image classification due to their simplicity, flexibility, and ease of implementation. They are effective for simple images and can be used for both binary and multi-class classification tasks. However, they struggle with complex patterns and noise, and are generally outperformed by CNNs. MLPs also require less computational resources, making them suitable for tasks with limited computational power.



The MLP-Mixer model is a type of neural network architecture designed for image classification, introduced in the paper "MLP-Mixer: An all-MLP Architecture for Vision" by Ilya Tolstikhin et al. Unlike traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or vision transformers (ViTs), the MLP-Mixer uses multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) exclusively. It achieves competitive performance on image classification tasks by mixing image patches (tokens) and their channels in a novel way.

Here's a brief overview of how to use the MLP-Mixer for image classification:

Patch Extraction: Divide the input image into non-overlapping patches.
Linear Embedding: Flatten each patch and project it into a higher-dimensional space using a linear layer.
Mixer Layers: Apply a series of Mixer layers that alternately mix spatial (token) and feature (channel) dimensions.
Classification Head: Use a global average pooling layer followed by a fully connected layer for classification.

The FNet model is a transformer-like architecture that leverages the Fourier Transform instead of the self-attention mechanism, reducing computational complexity while maintaining competitive performance. The key idea is to use Fourier Transforms to capture global dependencies in the data efficiently.

GMLPlayer (Graph Multi-Layer Perceptron) is a model designed for graph-structured data, combining the principles of Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). This model aims to leverage the expressive power of MLPs while effectively handling the relational structure of graph data.
