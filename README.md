# Image-Classification-with-MLP

MLPs are used for image classification due to their simplicity, flexibility, and ease of implementation. They are effective for simple images and can be used for both binary and multi-class classification tasks. However, they struggle with complex patterns and noise, and are generally outperformed by CNNs. MLPs also require less computational resources, making them suitable for tasks with limited computational power.
